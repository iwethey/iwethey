REQUIREMENTS

Q. What versions of 3rd party software are required?
A. J2SDK 1.4.1 or higher, Tomcat 4.1 or higher, and PostgreSQL 7.4.2 or higher.


BUILDING

Q. The build script prompts me for the PostgreSQL password.
A. Set the PGPASSWORD environment variable before running Ant.

Q. The build script fails with:
	java.io.FileNotFoundException: http://host:port/manager/list
A. Install the Tomcat administrative application.

Q. The build script prints the following warning:
	-tsearch-warn: [echo] ERROR: Unable to find tsearch2.sql at
		/usr/share/postgresql/contrib/tsearch2.sql!
A. Install the PostgreSQL contrib applications.


OPERATION

Q. When accessing the web application, I get the following error:
	java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError
	   at net.sf.hibernate.cfg.Configuration.<init>(Configuration.java:86)
A. Modify your catalina.policy file as described in the README, and make sure
   to restart Tomcat after making the changes.

Q. I changed my catalina.policy file as shown, but I still get the error.
A. Debian keeps its policy information for Tomcat in /etc/tomcat4/policy.d,
   and it overwrites the actual catalina.policy file every time Tomcat is
   restarted. Put the changes in /etc/tomcat4/policy.d/04webapps.policy.

Q. I changed my catalina.policy file as shown, but I *STILL* get the error.
A. Make sure the added settings are at the beginning of the grant{} section.

Q. When accessing the web application, I get the following error:
	A connection error has occurred: org.postgresql.util.PSQLException:
	FATAL: Password authentication failed for user "<someuser>"
A. Make sure your PostgreSQL installation allows remote connections. In the
   pg_hba.conf file, try something like this:
	local   all         all                                          trust
	host    all         all         127.0.0.1      255.255.255.255   trust
	host    all         all         0.0.0.0        0.0.0.0           reject
   Make sure there are no other active lines, and remember to restart PostgreSQL
   after your changes. If this fixes the problem, then you have a PostgreSQL
   authentication configuration problem, which is beyond the scope of this
   document to discuss.
